<p>Hey! I'm Jason. I love making things and helping others, with 25 years of software development experience spanning military and government contracting, startups, and large corporations. My programming journey began at age 8 on a Commodore 64, which I still enjoy firing up from time to time. As CTO and Engineering Manager, I lead our engineering vision and strategy while remaining connected to the teamâ€™s day-to-day through active work in frontend development.</p>
<p>My current passions are striving to become a better leader and developing uses for Local LLMs merged with frontend technology.</p>
